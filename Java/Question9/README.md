# Use of abstract, interface
Question: Create classes Food and Drink that extend the Product class, add subclass specific attributes and methods, override parent class methods and change 
        the Product class from concrete to abstract. 
Create class ProductManager and add factory methods to it to create instances of Food and Drink. The Shop class is then modified to use these factory methods instead of using constructors of Food and Drink directly.
